cause of errors
1. due to bias - accuracy and underfitting (inadequate model) - need a more
complex model
2. due to variance - precision and overfitting (too complex model) - training
more data or limit the complexity of model

** bias-variance dilemma & number of features -- there is a trade-off, needs
to find a sweet spot. ** 

** the curse of dimensionality -- as the number of features grows, the amount
of data we need to generalize accurately grows exponentially ** think of 10
sample points in each dimension, we need 10^d data points.
